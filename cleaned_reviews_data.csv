Have recently moved over from Android to IOS. Felt very happy about it.,4,80
"It's a apple device .. that means you get the good old ios . No performance issue , supper ram and power management . My slightly distasteful remark would be on its camera . Dont get me wrong , its great but the colors seems to be vibrant by default which I'm not really a fan of. Also the low light performance of the front camera is not that sharp . I used to own a pixel 3 and its front camera output seems to be better than iphone 13's . But overall the camera is good and it will do the job. ...",4,509
camera is not as expected at evening as pictures are so dull and not bright.so much dissipointed when compare camera even with s21fe or one plus nord or other premium phones.at bright sunlight or in a bright light at night pictures are so good in portrait mode.selfies in low light are terrible. looks like camera under 10k phone.battery is good and last for day easily.performance is so good.display may be if 90hz it will be good at this price range.,4,461

"The iPhone 14 is a solid choice for those looking for a high-quality smartphone experience. The camera is top-notch, the performance is smooth, and the design is sleek and modern. However, there are a few drawbacks to consider when comparing it to Android phones.One of the biggest cons of the iPhone 14 is its lack of customization options. Apple has a strict policy on what apps and features can be used on their devices, which can be frustrating for users who want more control over their pho...",3,507
"First ever experiencing Iphone. Being an android user and switching over to Iphone and using it for a day makes me a step away from android.1.Top Class Performance2. High defined Camera and Cinematic Video3. Pocket friendly comparing pro and plus models4. Have a concern on Battery , though drains on a single day usage - It doesnt means a negative feedback since its 20W Charger charged from 3 to 60 at a time of 10 minutes. I was too surprised- The best class in Apple Series.Last but n...",5,500
"Overall good experience (4 months review)Display : 60hz but impressive,Camera: if lighting condition is good then it can click very good photos but incase of poor lighting not good experience at such price point.Battery: It can give 5-6 hr of screentime, it can sustain whole day with single charge.but Battery health reduces 1% in my 4 months of usage which is quite shocking for me.Charging: Charging speed is quite good with 20w charger but at such price point it could be better.Conc...",4,499
"Very good purchase.i bought it for my wife as a Padwa gift.but just my views on purchasing this expensive phone- if you are using Iphone very lower version go for it but if you are already in iphone 13 or 11 do not spend money,its not worth.no much change.but if you have lots of money then go for it.wife was using iphone 7 hence i purchased this latest one.now no purchase atleast for 6 years. iphone 7 also used 5 years and believe me it has no issues at all, but the only problem was batte...",5,505
I using this mobile for 2 days before I using Samsung m30 so..... This iPhone was very handyPerformance a15 bionic with 6 core processorWe can't find the difference day to day life soo...this is awesome next camera camera is top notch I don't how to tell in words this very good camera same as dslr and videos is soo good quality but action mode is take 2.8k resolution and in dimlight is was sooo bad so while you take with action use gimbal ..... And over all the phone very good 👍,5,492
"I am very happy with the purchase , i was confused between blue and yellow but yellow is very bright and refreshing color and look different blue is also nice but after putting back cover we can not differentiate if its is iphone 13 or 14 better go for yellow iphone its very bright and attractive lot of people asked me if i bough new iphone or something thankyou flipkart now comes to the performance battery is good display is very smooth looks very premiums n feels very premium. Go for it",5,503
"I wanted to buy yellow colour but that was not delivering on my pin code so went for this colour.After receiving this, I have no regression.Love this.iPhone heats a lot because of its built. Its frame is steel and the back is glass but it has great things when it gets hot, it restricts some features to cool it down.The camera is good, sometimes it misses focus.Performance is the best part of it.",5,407
"I am using the product since quite a while now, I was previously having XR and this is 100% an upgrade on the same. Battery life is good and phone is a bit handy as well, though not as good as mini phones. Camera has definitely improved a lot in last 4 yrs and that's a massive upgrade. Altogether a great product and a no brainer if you are looking for a 5g handset with decent performance.",5,400
I used iPhone 12 mini and now upgraded with iPhone 14.Camera quality is awesome.Full day battery backup.Super Retina display with high dynamic range is awesome.In terms of camera and battery life is big upgrade for me.,5,227
Facing heating issues while playing video and using camera,4,67
Really disappointed with display and performance. Lagging in bgmi with graphics settings smooth + extreme. Hardly 50 fps. While lagging gives 25-30 fps which is frustrating for device like this.,1,203

Battery performance too low,1,36
"Hi, after using this device for 6months these are my experiences.1.) Light weight device, easy to carry in pocket.2.) Amazing battery backup.3.) Apps performance are good.4.) Sim network coverage is not Upto the mark, even with slight network drop tower goes off. Same SIM card has full network on another device but with this model of iPhone it is not the case.5.) Always have to switch between flight mode and normal to get the sim network.6.) Noise cancellation is missing, After paying c...",3,503

"Dear Team,I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction and disappointment with the recent purchase I made from your platform.I received an iPhone 14 (128GB) that has exhibited severe issues with its front camera, particularly when used in portrait mode with functions like black and white mode and background blur. These features are crucial to me, and the phone's inability to perform as expected is a significant concern.Moreover, I have reason to beli...",1,505
