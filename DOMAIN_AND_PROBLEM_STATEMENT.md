## 🎯 PROBLEM STATEMENT (Answer for Mentor)

**"Consumers struggle to make informed purchasing decisions in e-commerce due to:**

1. **Price Inconsistency:** Prices fluctuate frequently across platforms, making it hard to know when to buy
   - Example: iPhone 14 on Amazon: Rs.56k (Monday) → Rs.52k (Friday) - customer lost Rs.4k

2. **Sentiment Uncertainty:** Star ratings don't reveal actual product quality from review text
   - Example: 4.2★ product but 40% reviews say "fake product"

3. **Lack of Predictions:** No way to forecast if prices will drop
   - Example: Customer buys at Rs.55k, price drops to Rs.50k next week

4. **Cross-Platform Complexity:** Comparing Amazon vs Flipkart is manual and time-consuming

5. **Manual Monitoring:** Customers waste hours checking prices daily"
